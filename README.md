Welcome to the Event-Driven Trading System! This project implements an event-driven trading platform using Python, simulating the core components of a trading system with real-time events like price updates, trade orders, and executions.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Key Components:
- **Event**: A base class for all events in the system.
- **EventDispatcher**: The central dispatcher that manages events and sends them to listeners.
- **Exchange**: Simulates a cryptocurrency exchange that generates random price updates.
- **Trader**: Represents a trader who places buy/sell orders and sets stop-loss orders.
- **TradeEngine**: Executes trades and stores trade history.
- **Events**: Key events like `TradeOrderEvent`, `TradeExecutedEvent`, and `TradeNotificationEvent` are dispatched and processed.
