#Event-Driven Trading System

Welcome to the Event-Driven Trading System! This project implements an event-driven trading platform using Python, simulating the core components of a trading system with real-time events like price updates, trade orders, and executions.

##PROJECT OVERVIEW

##Key Components:
Event: A base class for all events in the system.
###EventDispatcher: The central dispatcher that manages events and sends them to listeners.
###Exchange: Simulates a cryptocurrency exchange that generates random price updates.
###Trader: Represents a trader who places buy/sell orders and sets stop-loss orders.
###TradeEngine: Executes trades and stores trade history.
###Events: Key events like TradeOrderEvent, TradeExecutedEvent, and TradeNotificationEvent are dispatched and processed.

FEATURES ✨

###Price Updates 📈: The Exchange class sends random price updates for cryptocurrency symbols.
###Trade Orders 💸: The Trader class can place buy/sell orders which are handled by the TradeEngine.
###Stop-Loss ⚠️: Traders can set stop-loss orders to sell automatically if the price drops below a certain threshold.
###Event System 🔄: The EventDispatcher class listens to and handles various events (e.g., price updates, trade notifications).
###Trade History 📜: The TradeEngine stores and displays a history of executed trades.
